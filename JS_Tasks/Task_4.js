// Rock, Paper, Sissors

// it should return you won or you lost based on the rules of the game (you may need to look up the rules if you have not played before)
// use math.random to determine the computers choice
// hint while you can complete this with only conditionals based on strings it may help to equate choice to a number


// Print/Keep Score
// choose Rock Paper Scissors with single buttons.
//      numbers? RPS?
// Add Lizard and Spock


//Set up the choices with what they can beat
